## Requirements

### iOS

- Minimum iOS Deployment Target: 12.0
- Xcode 13 or newer
- Swift 5
- ML Kit only supports 64-bit architectures (x86_64 and arm64). Check this [list](https://developer.apple.com/support/required-device-capabilities/) to see if your device has the required device capabilities. More info [here](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/migration/ios).

Since ML Kit does not support 32-bit architectures (i386 and armv7), you need to exclude armv7 architectures in Xcode in order to run `flutter build ios` or `flutter build ipa`. More info [here](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/migration/ios).

Go to Project > Runner > Building Settings > Excluded Architectures > Any SDK > armv7

![](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/blob/master/resources/build_settings_01.png)

Then your Podfile should look like this:

```ruby
# add this line:
$iOSVersion = '12.0'

post_install do |installer|
  # add these lines:
  installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=*]"] = "armv7"
    config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = $iOSVersion
  end
  
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    
    # add these lines:
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      if Gem::Version.new($iOSVersion) > Gem::Version.new(config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'])
        config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = $iOSVersion
      end
    end
    
  end
end
```

Notice that the minimum `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is 10.0, you can set it to something newer but not older.

### Android

- minSdkVersion: 21
- targetSdkVersion: 33
- compileSdkVersion: 33
